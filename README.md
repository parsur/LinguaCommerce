## About this

This project was coded on April for a rhetorical teacher. I have worked hard to be the best version of myself and optimized every single line of code to look simpler and more comfortable. my cooperation with a frontend developer helped me have a better aspect of team work which was a sensational experience.
I have been trying to improve it any time I find a new optmized way.

- Simple
- Fast
- Optimized
- Nice user interface

This project is accessible, powerful, and provides an easy tool to CRUD.
